# Game over

## Assignment

Create a game using a 3rd party WebGL framework such as, PixiJS, Phaser, p5.js or three.js

## The game

We have created a game that is an easier and more simple version of the popular game germs.io. But instead of having a multiplayer version we wanted to create a relaxing game that you're able to play for just a few minutes or as long as you like.

[Play the game here!](https://germs-maybe.netlify.app)
